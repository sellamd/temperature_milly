Hello !!
This project is very common and usual one.
It helps me monitor temperature inside my holiday hom in France.
It basically records temperature every hour and store it in a DB.
It send daily email with MIN/MAX INDOOR/OUTDOOR temperature.
It is based on RaspberryPi hardware and 2 DS1820 sensors.
